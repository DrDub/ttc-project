/**
 * Model part of the MVC paradigm used for the application.
 * The TermSuite application is made of tools (Spotter, Indexer, Aligner) that are each designed
 * according to the MVC paradigm and so made of a view, a controller and a model. This class
 * is the abstract implementation of the model part of the tools.
 *
 * In our implementation, the model does not know about the controller or the views. It simply
 * informs all PropertyChangeListener of anything going on.
 * Each tool is responsible of its own configuration persistence. Therefore the ToolModel must
 * be able to persist any data related to the configuration. Most likely this data is persisted
 * as UIMA parameters.
