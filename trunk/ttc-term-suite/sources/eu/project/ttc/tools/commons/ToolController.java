/**
 * Controller part of the MVC paradigm used for the application.
 * The TermSuite application is made of tools (Spotter, Indexer, Aligner) that are each designed
 * according to the MVC paradigm and so made of a view, a controller and a model. This class
 * is the abstract implementation of the controller part of the tools.
 *
 * In our implementation, the controller is the bound between views and controllers. It is the
 * one responsible for binding them together and flowing the data from one another.
 * This controller implements the {@link PropertyChangeListener} interface so that it can listen
 * for changing properties both in the models and in the views so that it can reflect the changes.
