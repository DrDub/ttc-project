<center><h1>Indexing terms</h1></center>
<p>The <b>Indexer</b> compiles all term candidates identified by the Spotter to build a bank of terms.
    Several grouping of term variants, and several ranking and filtering are available depending on the configuration.
    The output of the Indexer is a termilogy file that is exported in XMI and TBX formats.</p>
<p>The files containing the term candidates are loaded from an <i>input directory</i> as exported by the Spotter in XMI
    format.</p>
<p>The parameters of the <b>Basic</b> panel are mandatory. There are many configuration possibilities that will control the extraction of candidate terms.
    You can explore them inside the <b>Variant detection</b> panel and the <b>Filtering and Export</b> panel.</p>
<p>Fill the various parameters, click on the <b>Run</b> button on the top left of this window to launch the processing. Click on the <b>Save</b> button on the top right of this window if you wish to keep this parameter configuration for a next run.</p>
