<center><h1>Indexing terms</h1></center>
<p>The <b>Indexer</b> compiles all term candidates identified by the Spotter to build a bank of terms. In the process
    it may combine several term candidates as one depending on the configuration.</p>
<p>The files containing the term candidates are found in an <i>input directory</i> as exported by the Spotter in XMI
    format.</p>
<p>There is a lot of configuration possibilities to control the way the term candidates are combined as well as
    the export of the compiled and combined terms. You can explore them below.</p>
<p>Once you have filled the various parameters, you can click on the <b>Run</b> button on the top left of this
window to launch the processing.</p>
