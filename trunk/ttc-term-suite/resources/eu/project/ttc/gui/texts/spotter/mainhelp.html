<center><h1>Spotting terms</h1></center>
<p>The <b>Spotter</b> performs linguistic preprocessing: tokenization, POS tagging and lemmatization. It also detects the occurrences of single-word terms (SWT) and multi-word terms (MWT).
The text files (.txt files) are found in an <i>input directory</i> and the processed files (.xmi files) are stored in an <i>output directory</i>.</p>
<p>The <b>Spotter</b> needs TreeTagger to be installed by the TermSuite user to process De, En, Es, Fr, Ru, Zh. TreeTagger performs POS tagging and lemmatization.</p>
<p>Fill the various parameters, click on the <b>Run</b> button on the top left of this window to launch the processing. Click on the <b>Save</b> button on the top right of this window if you wish to keep this parameter configuration for a next run.</p>
