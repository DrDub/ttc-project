== Type System == 

The [http://code.google.com/p/ttc-project/source/browse/trunk/resources/eu/project/ttc/types/TermSuiteTypeSystem.xml TermSuite Type System] define how information is structured by any Term Suite components and applications. 

There exist 3 main annotation types that are respectively:
 * the type _WordAnnotation_ identifies a word with Multext-compliant  grammatical features;
 * the type _TermAnnotation_ is used as well term occurrence detection as for term entry indexation;
 * the type _TranslationCandidateAnnotation_ receives every alignment results for a given term to translate.

*Note:* every annotation types should be prefixed by the path _eu.project.ttc.types._; such prefix is here removed for shortening their notations. 

Moreover, annotation types such as _TranslationCandidateAnnotation_ are refered below as _Translation Candidate Annotation_ for readability reasons.

=== Term Component Annotation ===

The annotation type _Term Component Annotation_ defines the required features for multi-word term components as well as for single-word compounds:
 * the String feature _category_ corresponds to the Multext grammatical category normalized and expansed value i.e. it ranges over noun, verb, adjective, pronoun, determiner, article, adposition, conjunction, abbreviation (see [http://aune.lpl.univ-aix.fr/projects/multext/LEX/LEX.Specification.html Multext])
 * the String feature _lemma_ corresponds to the TreeTagger lemma
 * the String feature _stem_ corresponds to the stem provided by Porter's algorithm

=== Word Annotation ===

The annotation type _Word Annotation_ extends that of _Term Component Annotation_ by these following features:
 * the String feature _tag_ corresponds to the TreeTagger original tag
 * the String feature _subCategory_ corresponds to the sub-category of the Multext category
 * the String feature _mood_ corresponds to the mood of the Multext category verb
 * the String feature _tense_ corresponds to the mood of the Multext category verb
 * the String feature _number_ corresponds to the number of the Multext categories noun, verb, adjective, pronoun, determiner, article and numeral
 * the String feature _gender_ corresponds to the gender of the Multext categories noun, verb, adjective, pronoun, determiner, article and numeral
 * the String feature _case_ corresponds to the case of the Multext categories noun, adjective, pronoun, determiner, article and numeral
 * the String feature _person_ corresponds to the case of the Multext categories verb, pronoun, determiner and article 
 * the String feature _possessor_ corresponds to the case of the Multext categories pronoun and determiner
 * the String feature _degree_ corresponds to the case of the Multext category adverb
 * the String feature _formation_ corresponds to the case of the Multext category adposition

=== Term Annotation ===

The annotation type _Term Annotation_ is used both for term instances in corpus documents and term entries of the corpus terminology. It owns the following features:
 * the _String_ feature _category_ corresponds to the identifier of the syntactic pattern which such term instances or term entries has been 
detected from 
 * the _Double_ feature _lemma_ corresponds to the lemmatized for of such terms i.e. the lemma for a simple term or the lemma sequence of complex term components
 * the _Integer_ feature _occurrences_ corresponds to the absolute frequency of term entries
 * the _Double_ feature _frequency_ corresponds to the relative frequency of term entries
 * the _Double_ feature _specificity_ corresponds to the domain specificity of term entries i.e. the quotient of such term relative frequency against the relative frequency of the same term in a general language corpus
 * the array of _String_ feature _forms_ lists every term instance forms this term entry is indexed from
 * the array of _Term Annotation_ feature _variants_ references the term variants of term entries
 * the array of _Term Annotation_ feature _context_ references term annotations in the contextual window of term instances
