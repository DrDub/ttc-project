=== Can I launch Term Suite without its GUI? ===

However, *every UIMA analysis engines can be launched in CLI* 
by the help of the inner devoted Java class _TermSuiteRunner_. 
For example, the French Spotter can be launched over UTF-8 text files s follows:
{{{
  java -cp target/ttc-term-suite-1.2.jar eu.project.ttc.tools.TermSuiteRunner -txt -analysis-engine eu.project.ttc.french.engines.spotter.FrenchSpotter -directory /path/to/corpus/wind-energy/French/txt -language fr -encoding utf-8 --TreeTaggerHomeDirectory /usr/local/share/tree-tagger
