== Description ==

This is the UIMA application of the European project [http://www.ttc-project.eu/index.php TTC] _Terminology Extraction, Translation Tools and Comparable Corpora_. This project aims at leveraging machine translation, computer-assisted translation and multilingual content management tools by automatically generating bilingual terminologies from comparable corpora in five European languages (English, French, German, Spanish and one under-resourced language, Latvian), as well as in Chinese and Russian.

TTC Term Suite is powered by:
  * the Java programming language and runtime environment, 
  * the framework [http://uima.apache.org/ Apache UIMA], 
  * the part-of-speech tagger and lemmatizer [http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/corplex/TreeTagger/ TreeTagger],
  * the Java library [http://code.google.com/p/tt4j/ tt4j] for embedding TreeTagger in Java.
