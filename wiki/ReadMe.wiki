== Description ==

This is the UIMA application of the European project [http://www.ttc-project.eu/index.php TTC] _Terminology Extraction, Translation Tools and Comparable Corpora_. This project aims at leveraging machine translation, computer-assisted translation and multilingual content management tools by automatically generating bilingual terminologies from comparable corpora in five European languages (English, French, German, Spanish and one under-resourced language, Latvian), as well as in Chinese and Russian.

== Dependencies ==

TTC Term Suite is powered by:
  * the Java programming language and runtime environment, 
  * the framework [http://uima.apache.org/ Apache UIMA], 
  * the part-of-speech tagger and lemmatizer [http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/corplex/TreeTagger/ TreeTagger],
  * the Java library [http://code.google.com/p/tt4j/ tt4j] for embedding TreeTagger in Java.

However, you just have to install Java and TreeTagger by yourself. 
The Apache UIMA and tt4j libraries are already embedded into 
Term Suite as their respective licences make it possible. 

== Requirements ==

First, please check that are installed on your computer: 
  * a Java 6 Runtime Environment ([http://www.java.com/fr/download/ Sun] or [http://openjdk.java.net/install/ OpenJDK]),
  * the part-of-speech tagger and lemmatizer [http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/corplex/TreeTagger/ TreeTagger].

*Warning*: Term Suite expects to find TreeTagger's parameter files in the _lib/_ subdirectory of the TreeTagger home directory i.e. the folder where TreeTagger is installed on your computer. By default, these parameter files belong to the _lib/_ subdirectory. Please check that and create a link from  _models/_ to _lib/_ if necessary.

== Installation ==

You may download the [http://ttc-project.googlecode.com/files/ttc-term-suite-1.1.jar TTC Term Suite] executable Java archive and open it within a Java 6 Runtime Environment or by the help of the following command line:
 java -jar ttc-term-suite-1.1.jar

== Resources == 

Term Suite requires you to provide at least 2 kinds of resources: 
2 corpora and 1 list of terms to translate. The first kind of resources 
is required by the first Term Suite's tool whereas the second kind of resources is required by the last one.

=== Corpora ===

The first kind of resources consists in _comparable_ corpora 
that is provided by text files. These files should be 
in the same directory, not in its subdirectories 
and without any other text files in it.

=== List of translations ===

The list of terms to translate is provided by text files in a proper directory. Such files should at least look like that:
{{{
  renewable energy
}}} 
i.e. a file containing just a term.

You can provide one or more correct translations of the given term 
by separating the term and each translation by tabulations as below:
{{{
  énergie	energy	power
}}}
These correct translations can be useful for evaluation purpose.

This can also be used as well for simple terms as for complex terms:
{{{
  énergie renouvelable	renewable energy
}}}

=== Dictionary ===

A tiny bilingual dictionary is used by default in Term Suite. 
However, you are strongly recommended to enrich it by your own dictionary. The latter should comply the following format: 
a source entry per line separated by a tabulation with 
In other words, dictionaries should look like that:
{{{
  ...
  énergie	energy
  énergie	power
  énergie	vigueur
  ...
  puissance	power
  ...
}}}
