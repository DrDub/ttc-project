== Description ==

This is the UIMA application of the European project [http://www.ttc-project.eu/index.php TTC] _Terminology Extraction, Translation Tools and Comparable Corpora_. This project aims at leveraging machine translation, computer-assisted translation and multilingual content management tools by automatically generating bilingual terminologies from comparable corpora in five European languages (English, French, German, Spanish and one under-resourced language, Latvian), as well as in Chinese and Russian.

== Dependencies ==

TTC Term Suite is powered by:
  * the Java programming language and runtime environment, 
  * the framework [http://uima.apache.org/ Apache UIMA], 
  * the part-of-speech tagger and lemmatizer [http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/corplex/TreeTagger/ TreeTagger],
  * the Java library [http://code.google.com/p/tt4j/ tt4j] for embedding TreeTagger in Java.

However, you just have to install Java and TreeTagger by yourself. 
The Apache UIMA and tt4j libraries are already embedded into 
Term Suite as their respective licences make it possible. 

== Requirements ==

First, please check that are installed on your computer: 
  * a Java 6 Runtime Environment ([http://www.java.com/fr/download/ Sun] or [http://openjdk.java.net/install/ OpenJDK]),
  * the part-of-speech tagger and lemmatizer [http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/corplex/TreeTagger/ TreeTagger].

*Warning*: Term Suite expects to find TreeTagger's parameter files in the _lib/_ subdirectory of the TreeTagger home directory i.e. the folder where TreeTagger is installed on your computer. By default, these parameter files belong to the _lib/_ subdirectory. Please check that and create a link from  _models/_ to _lib/_ if necessary.

== Install ==

You may download the [http://ttc-project.googlecode.com/files/ttc-term-suite-1.1.jar TTC Term Suite] executable Java archive and open it within a Java 6 Runtime Environment or by the help of the following command line:
 java -jar ttc-term-suite-1.1.jar
