== Description ==

TermSuite is an UIMA application for monolingual and bilingual term extraction
from comparable corpora. 
Languages: English, French, German, Spanish, Latvian, Chinese and Russian.

Fp7 European project [http://www.ttc-project.eu/index.php TTC] _Terminology Extraction, Translation Tools and Comparable Corpora_. 


== Dependencies ==

TTC Term Suite is powered by:
  * the Java programming language and runtime environment, 
  * the framework [http://uima.apache.org/ Apache UIMA], 
  * the part-of-speech tagger and lemmatizer [http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/corplex/TreeTagger/ TreeTagger],
  * the Java library [http://code.google.com/p/tt4j/ tt4j] for embedding TreeTagger in Java.

TermSuite requires that Java and TreeTagger are already installed on your computer.

TermSuite embeds The Apache UIMA and tt4j libraries as their respective licences make it possible. 

== Requirements ==

Please check that are installed on your computer: 
  * a Java 6 Runtime Environment ([http://www.java.com/fr/download/ Sun] or [http://openjdk.java.net/install/ OpenJDK]),
  * the part-of-speech tagger and lemmatizer [http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/corplex/TreeTagger/ TreeTagger].

*Warning*: Term Suite expects to find TreeTagger's parameter files in the _lib/_ subdirectory of the TreeTagger home directory i.e. the folder where TreeTagger is installed on your computer. By default, these parameter files belong to the _lib/_ subdirectory. Please check that and create a link from  _models/_ to _lib/_ if necessary.

Comparable corpora: all linguistic resources (corpus, dictionary) should be encoded in UTF8 for all languages.

== Installation ==

- Download the [http://ttc-project.googlecode.com/files/ttc-term-suite-1.3.jar TTC Term Suite] executable Java archive
- Run it with the command line:

java -Xms1g -Xmx2g -jar ttc-term-suite-1.3.jar

- Have a look to the Wiki/GettingStart and Wiki/userGuide

== Resources == 

- For Monolingual term extraction, Term Suite requires one corpus encoded in UTF8
- For bilingual term extraction, Term Suite requires encoded in UTF8 :
        - 2 corpora: one in source language and in target language;
        - 1 list of  source terms to translate;
        - a general bilingual dictionary

=== Corpora ===

_A corpora is a set of text files that should be in one directory.
The corpora directory shoud not contains  subdirectories nor any other text files.

=== List of translations ===

The list of terms to translate is provided by text files in a proper directory. Such files should at least look like that:
{{{
  renewable energy
}}} 
i.e. a file containing just a term.

You can provide one or more correct translations of the given term 
by separating the term and each translation by tabulations as below:
{{{
  énergie	energy	power
}}}
These correct translations can be useful for evaluation purpose.

This can also be used as well for simple terms as for complex terms:
{{{
  énergie renouvelable	renewable energy
}}}

=== Dictionary ===

A tiny bilingual dictionary is used by default in Term Suite. 
However, you are strongly recommended to enrich it by your own dictionary. The latter should comply the following format: 
a source entry per line separated by a tabulation with 
In other words, dictionaries should look like that:
{{{
  ...
  énergie	energy
  énergie	power
  énergie	vigueur
  ...
  puissance	power
  ...
}}}
